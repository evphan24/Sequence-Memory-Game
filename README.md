# Sequence Memory Game

**This is a sequence memory game written in Verilog for the DE1-SoC. The user is shown a grid of 4 squares where a coloured pattern will be displayed and the user must match the pattern by inputting through the 4 keys on the FPGA board. The speed the pattern is displayed increases every level and at the end of the game the user is shown a bouncing smiley or sad face if they win or lose.**

## Usage
This project makes use of 1-port ROM modules generated by the Quartus II software, and are configured to read the data in the mif files. The program displays white or another colour based on the 1 and 0 values in the mif files and are used to display the smiley and sad faces at when the game terminates. The mif files were created this way to use a minimal amount of storage on the board, but can be modified to contain the values of the desired colours.
