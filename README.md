# Sequence Memory Game

**This is a sequence memory game written in Verilog for the DE1-SoC. The user is shown a grid of 4 squares where a coloured pattern will be displayed and the user must match the pattern by inputting through the 4 keys on the FPGA board. The speed the pattern is displayed increases every level and at the end of the game the user is shown a bouncing smiley or sad face if they win or lose.**
